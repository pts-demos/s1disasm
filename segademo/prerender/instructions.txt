To generate a prerendered tileset from Blender

* Set a Blender scene with the following settings
    * background shading to transparency
    * render reso to the size of one full sprite in the tileset
    * render the animation as a sequence of RGBA PNGs
* Use montage to combinet them
    montage -background none *.png -geometry 80x80+0+0 -tile '16x' out.png
* Open the image in gimp and go to Image -> Mode -> Indexed and choose < 16 as the num of colors
* Save the image in res/sprites/something.png
* Customize res/sprites.res
    * The params are:
    SPRITE default_cube_sprite "sprite/default_cube.png" 10 10 NONE 5
           ^ variable name      ^ path to the image      ^ width and height in 8x8 tiles (ie 10 means 80 pixels)
    The final 5 is for animation playback speed
